## Activity: Manual intensity measurements

Let's measure the sum intensity of two nuclei in a widefield microscopy image. Assuming that the staining is quantitative this gives us information on the cell cycle state (because the DNA content doubles during the cell cycle).

- Open “../image-inspection/B.tif”
- Record a ROI around one nuclues:
	- Draw a region around a nucleus, e.g. using ImageJ's Polygon Selection
		- We will do sum intensity measurements with background subtraction, thus one should draw this region rather generously not to miss any intensities!
	- Add region to ROI manager [Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager > Add)
	- Name the region “nucleus_1” [Analyze > Tools > ROI Manager > Rename]
- Repeat above steps:
	- Choosing another nucleus (maybe one that clearly appears dimmer or brighter than the first one).
		- "nucleus_2"
	- Now choosing a background region (strongly increase the image brightness to find a clean background region). 
		- "background"
		 
- Select measurements [Analyze > Set Measurements]:
	- [X] Mean gray value
	- [X] Area
	- [X] Integrated density
		- This measures the sum intensity; in fact it will output two values; the "good" one is the **RawIntDen**, which really simply adds up the gray values in the measurement ROI.
- Select all regions and measure [ROI Manager > Measure]

Now we need to do the proper background subtraction for the two nuclei ROIs, using below formula:

`Sum_BgCorr = RawIntDen - Area * Mean_Background`

In words, we subtract for each pixel in the ROI the mean value of the background.

Two compare the intensities of the two nuclei, typically computing the ratio of the sum intensities is a good readout.

In this case, given the staining is quantitative, this could be used to measure the cell cycle state.

## Intensity measurements and their interpretation,  with local background

Intensity measurements are a **very tricky business**, not because they are technically difficult, but because one can make many mistakes in the interpretation of the numbers. This very easily leads to wrong scientific conclusions!

## Activity: Intensity measurements with local background subtraction

In biology, almost always there is some "background" intensity. It is very important to think about what kind of background it is and how to deal with it. Again, wrong decisions here can yield wrong biological conclusions. In this activity we will practice some of the most common issues.

Let's first open the images:

- Open all images in this folder "../dna-damage-synthetic-data/"

We pretent that these are **widefield microscopy** images of one nucleus where a GFP-tagged DNA damage repair enzyme is diffusing around. In some of the images a well controlled laser cut was induced and thus the DNA repair enzyme binds the damage site. Some images say "Treated" in their title. The idea is that the scientist added a drug and wanted to find out if this drug enhances or diminishes the binding of the DNA repair enzyme. 

### Examine with line profile

Let's first look at the images using an intensity line profile and discuss what we see.

### Measure fraction of protein bound to damage site

Ok, now let's try to measure a number that is robust with respect to microscope settings and also has some biological meaning. This is generally challenging and one has to think about it for every project. 

In this case, assuming 

- this is widefield microscopy, and
- the unbound molecule is fast diffusing, and
- the laser cut had the exact same strength in all experiments

it probably makes sense to divide the sum intensity of the bound protein by the sum intensity in the nucleus; i.e. total_bound / total_available. This gives the fraction of protein bound to the damage site, which has the following nice properties, it is:

- independent of microscope settings
- always a number between 0 and 1
- closer to 1 the "better" the protein binds to the damage site

One could put more thought into this and try to relate this to a real binding rate constant (K_A), but this goes beyond the scope of this tutorial. 

To measure the **fraction of bound protein** we need to measure:

- mean intensity outside the nucleus (mean_bg)
- mean intensity next to damage site inside the nucleus (mean_nucleus_diffusive)
- sum intensity of nucleus and area of corresponding ROI (sum_nucleus, area_nucleus_ROI)
- sum intensity of damage site and area of corresponding ROI (sum_damage, area_damage_ROI)

Now we need to compute:

- total_signal_nucleus = sum_nucleus - area_nucleus_ROI * mean_bg
- total_signal_damage = sum_damage - area_damage_ROI * mean_nucleus_diffusive

And finally:

- fraction_bound_to_damage = total_signal_damage / total_signal_nucleus

Hard work, right? And many options to make little mistakes, thus we only should preform intensity measurements with utmost care!

## Discussion points


- Divide by the length (and or width) of the laser damage cut?
	- length makes sense
	- width probably not

- How do our observations relate to this: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_constant

- What about computing the mean intensity in the nucleus next to the damage site?
	- In principle attractive, because for a association rate constant (K_A) we need the concentration of the unbound protein.
	- For a confocal image this can make sense if there are not many substructures in the nucleus (like nucleoli). Basically, if the concentration of the protein is homgeneous, the mean intensity gives information about the concentration of the unbound protein.
		- However, it is less obvious how to measure the concentration of the bound protein, as required for a K_A, probably one needs something else?!
	- For a widefield image the PSF is unbounded in 3D and it is thus not clear at all how to measure a concentration.
