# 2018 May 7th-9th: Basics of Image Analysis using Imagej 

## Location:

ATC Computer Training Lab 

## Prerequisites

In order to save some time, and since many of you took part in the ALMF Basics in Microscopy courses, we will not repeat what has been thaught there already. If you did not attend it would be good if you had a look at the material:

- Basic handling of the [ImageJ](https://fiji.sc/) software 
- [Image inspection and handling](https://github.com/tischi/imagej-courses/blob/master/practicals/basic-image-inspection-and-handling.md)
- [3D image inspection](https://github.com/tischi/imagej-courses/blob/master/practicals/3D-image-inspection.md)

But, don't worry, even if you don't know above material you'll be able to follow the course.

## Schedule

Note that there will be coffee breaks, one in the morning and one in the afternoon, even though they are not explicitely scheduled!
